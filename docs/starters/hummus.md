## Ingredients
* Tahini (linseed paste)
* Dried chickpeas (soaked overnight)
* Jalapenos
* Chilli flakes/powder
  
## Method
1. Add Tahini and chickpeas into food processor and mix
2. Mix in spices as desired. Fairly tasteless on itâ€™s own, Jalapenos was great. Chilli was great. Use whatever you want to flavour it.
3. Serve with Pita bread, salad, breadsticks...etc.
